About Me

Hello! I'm David Machua, a dedicated Business and IT student at Kenya Methodist University. With a background as an Admin Assistant at Al-Shams International, a manpower recruitment agency based in Mombasa,Kenya, I've honed my organizational skills and attention to detail.

Driven by a passion for positive change, I'm also the co-founder and managing director of Team HK4L CBO, an organization committed to empowering youth through education and mentorship.

My journey encompasses a fusion of technology and creativity. As I pursue my studies, I'm concurrently learning the ropes of front-end web development and music production. This synergy empowers me to bring innovative solutions to the forefront.

On this platform, you'll discover a showcase of my projects, insights, and endeavors. I'm excited to share my experiences, connect with like-minded individuals, and contribute to a brighter future.

Let's collaborate, innovate, and create together. Contact me at [your.email@example.com] to explore opportunities or simply say hello!
